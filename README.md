# Archive - EaselJs: Math Animation

This is an **_Archive from the Early Days_**, trivially experimenting with
canvas based animation using SVG, the Math API and EaselJs.

It included fooling about with:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
4. JQUERY
5. CANVAS
6. SVG
7. MATH
8. EASELJS

The demo can be viewed on [Code Pen](http://codepen.io/vamtiger/full/jqxxrZ/).
